# Introduction

Single cell sequencing unveils a treasure trove into the biological and molecular characteristics of samples. Here we introduce `LotOfCells`: a simple R package designed to explore the intricate landscape of phenotype data within single-cell studies. An archetypal example of such analysis would be to test the differences in proportion between cell-types across conditions, but it can be used in many scenarios e.g: test if a specific cell-type or class proportion is dependent of sequencing date as a quality check.

# Manual

`LotOfCells` is compatible with `Seurat` and `SingleCellExperiment` objects. You can also directly provide a dataframe with the metadata.
All functions require the following inputs:
-   `scObject`: An object of class `Seurat` or `SingleCellExperiment`, or a dataframe containing the metadata.
-   `main_variable`: Column name containing the main class variable (e.g., condition, treatment, tissue).
-   `subtype_variable`: Column name containing the subtype class variable (e.g., cell type, sequencing date, cluster).
-   `sample_id` (optional): Column name containing the sample/patient ID variable. If provided, tests will simulate proportion variability per sample, and plots will show each individual.

### Examples

We will construct a simulated dataset of single-cell metadata consisting of six samples with two conditions (mutant and wild type), including four cell types (A, B, C, D) and different time points simulating treatment (time 0h, 2h, 4h):

```{r construct}

# # Data simulation with 2 conditions, 3 time points, and 4 cell-types:
sample1 <- c(rep("CellTypeA",700),rep("CellTypeB",300),rep("CellTypeC",500),rep("CellTypeD",1000))
sample2 <- c(rep("CellTypeA",1700),rep("CellTypeB",350),rep("CellTypeC",550),rep("CellTypeD",800))
sample3 <- c(rep("CellTypeA",1200),rep("CellTypeB",200),rep("CellTypeC",420),rep("CellTypeD",800))
sample4 <- c(rep("CellTypeA",500),rep("CellTypeB",1000),rep("CellTypeC",10),rep("CellTypeD",1200))
sample5 <- c(rep("CellTypeA",550),rep("CellTypeB",990),rep("CellTypeC",10),rep("CellTypeD",1100))
sample6 <- c(rep("CellTypeA",1350),rep("CellTypeB",590),rep("CellTypeC",300),rep("CellTypeD",600))
sample <- c(rep("A",length(sample1)),rep("B",length(sample2)),rep("C",length(sample3)),rep("D",length(sample4)),rep("E",length(sample5)),rep("F",length(sample6)))
times <- c(rep("time 0h",length(sample1)),rep("time 0h",length(sample2)),rep("time 2h",length(sample3)),rep("time 2h",length(sample4)),rep("time 4h",length(sample5)),rep("time 4h",length(sample6)))
cell_type <- c(sample1, sample2, sample3, sample4, sample5, sample6)
meta.data <- data.frame(sample, cell_type, times)
meta.data$condition <- "wt"
meta.data[meta.data$sample %in% c("B","D","F"),]$condition <- "mut"
rownames(meta.data) <- as.character(1:nrow(meta.data))
head(meta.data)

```

First, let's visualize the data using `LotOfCells`. In these functions, you can also specify:

-   `subtype_only`: Visualize only a specific class from `subtype_variable`. Useful if for example you only want to show the proportions of a specific cell type or subclass.

### Barplots

Barplots are displayed in such an order that the class with the largest average proportion is always at the bottom, making it easier to compare smaller groups at the top.

`LotOfCells` can be used with any other combination of variables (different from cell type). Here (Figure D), by switching the `subtype_variable` to the time-points we can investigate the contribution of time-points to the main condition, serving as a quality check to understand the weight of some covarites to the target condition (e.g. time points, sequencing dates or different tissues):

```{r, eval=False }
# # Test of barplot charts:
# All cells together for every group:
g.A <- bar_chart(meta.data, main_variable = "condition", subtype_variable = "cell_type")
# Barplot for each individual sample:
g.B <- bar_chart(meta.data, main_variable = "condition",subtype_variable = "cell_type",
                 sample_id = "sample")
# Display One-Class only:
g.C <- bar_chart(meta.data, main_variable = "condition",subtype_variable = "cell_type",
                 sample_id = "sample", subtype_only = "CellTypeD")
# Distribution of time-points by condition:
g.D <- bar_chart(meta.data, main_variable = "condition",subtype_variable = "times")

ggpubr::ggarrange(g.A, g.B, g.C, g.D, labels = c("A", "B", "C","D"),
                  ncol=2, nrow=2, common.legend = F)

```

### Contribution of a class to the global population in barplots

If we want to visualize the contribution to the global proportion of a specific class (e.g.: how much each sample contribute to each cell type proportion), we can use the `contribution = TRUE` flag when setting the `sample_id` variable:

```{r}
# Examine the contribution of each sample to the proportions of cell types per condition:
g.A <- bar_chart(meta.data, main_variable = "condition",subtype_variable = "cell_type",
                 sample_id = "sample", contribution = TRUE)
# Examine the contribution of each sample to the proportions of cell types per time point:
g.B <- bar_chart(meta.data, main_variable = "times",subtype_variable = "cell_type",
                 sample_id = "sample", contribution = TRUE)

ggpubr::ggarrange(g.A, g.B, labels = c("A", "B"),
                  ncol=2, nrow=1, common.legend = F)
```

<img src="./images/Figure1.2_LoC.jpeg" alt="LotOfCells barplots" width="700" height="400" />
<figcaption><i> Example barplots with contribution per class. </i></figcaption>
</figure>

### Waffles

To visualize small proportions using waffle plots might be more advisable:

```{r}
# # Test of Waffles charts:
# All cells together for every group
g.A <- waffle_chart(meta.data, main_variable = "condition", subtype_variable = "cell_type")
# Waffle for each individual sample:
g.B <- waffle_chart(meta.data, main_variable = "condition", subtype_variable = "cell_type", 
                    sample_id = "sample")
# One-Class only:
g.C <- waffle_chart(meta.data, main_variable = "condition",subtype_variable = "cell_type", 
                    sample_id = "sample",subtype_only = "CellTypeD")
# One-Class only all samples together:
g.D <- waffle_chart(meta.data, main_variable = "condition", subtype_variable = "cell_type", 
                    subtype_only = "CellTypeD")

ggpubr::ggarrange(g.B, g.A, g.C, g.D, labels = c("A", "B", "C", "D"),
                  ncol=2, nrow=2, widths = c(0.6,0.2), align = "hv")
```

<figure>
<img src="./images/Figure2_LoC.jpeg" alt="LotOfCells waffle plots" />
<figcaption><i> Example waffle plots. </i></figcaption>
</figure>

### Density ridge plots

To visualize numeric values (including gene/feature expression) over groups and sub-categories, we can make use of density ridge plots to observe its data distribution. We have to select the variable to use in `numerical_variable`.

```{r}
# # Test of density charts:
# simulate the number of RNA features detected in each cell:
meta.data <- rbind.data.frame(meta.data %>% dplyr::filter(condition == "mut") %>% 
                                mutate(n_features_RNA = abs(rnorm(nrow(.), mean=c(3000, 3500), sd=800))),
                              meta.data %>% dplyr::filter(condition == "wt") %>% 
                                mutate(n_features_RNA = abs(rnorm(nrow(.), mean=c(2500,1500), sd=400))))

# All cells together for every group
g.A <- density_chart(scObject = meta.data, main_variable = "condition", subtype_variable = "covariable", 
                    numerical_variable = "n_features_RNA")
# Density chart for each individual sample:
g.B <- density_chart(scObject = meta.data, main_variable = "condition", subtype_variable = "covariable",  
                    numerical_variable = "n_features_RNA", sample_id = "sample")

ggpubr::ggarrange(g.A, g.B, labels = c("A", "B"),
                  ncol=2, nrow=1, common.legend = F)
```

<figure>
<img src="./images/Figure_3.1.1.jpeg" alt="LotOfCells density plots" />
<figcaption><i> Example density plots. </i></figcaption>
</figure>

If `scObject` is of class `Seurat` or `SingleCellExperiment`, we can specify a gene/feature name directly in `subtype_variable` to display the counts per class and sub-level. Here we show an example using human pancreas single-cell data (Baron M et al. (2017) using the scRNAseq R package), the gene SST is a marker of pancreatic $\delta cells:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# # Test of density charts:
density_chart(scObject = sc_pancreas_human, main_variable = "donor", subtype_variable = "cell.type", 
              numerical_variable = "SST")

```

<figure>
<img src="./images/Figure_3.1.2.jpeg" alt="LotOfCells density plots of gene expression" />
<figcaption><i> Example density plots showing expression of SST in delta cells. </i></figcaption>
</figure>


### Personalizing the colors:

Colors can be easily changed for bar, waffle, or polar plots using the `colors` option. To do this, simply provide a vector of colors to use. If the specified colors are insufficient, a palette will be created using colorRampPalette based on the colors specified. If no colors are specified, the default color palette of LotOfCells will be used.

```{r}
# # Using different colors:
# We can use RColorBrewer to easily obtain a different palette of colors:
g.A <- bar_chart(meta.data, main_variable = "condition", subtype_variable = "cell_type", 
                 sample_id = "sample", colors = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(8, "Set3"))
g.B <- waffle_chart(meta.data, main_variable = "condition", subtype_variable = "cell_type", 
                    sample_id = "sample", colors = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(8, "Pastel2"))

ggpubr::ggarrange(g.A, g.B, labels = c("A", "B"), ncol=2, nrow=1, widths = c(0.4,0.6))
```

<figure>
<img src="./images/Figure2.2_LoC.jpeg" alt="LotOfCells changing the colors" width="800" height="320" />
<figcaption><i> Example using personalised color palette. </i></figcaption>
</figure>

### Polar plots

Lastly, this visualization might be interesting to compare raw number of cells per class (e.g.: if a sample has a much larger number of cells, which might affect downstream analysis).

```{r}
# Test of circle polar plot:
polar_chart(meta.data, main_variable = "condition",subtype_variable = "cell_type", sample_id = "sample")
# Test of polar plot by cell-type:
polar_chart(meta.data, main_variable = "cell_type",subtype_variable = "sample")
```

### Parallelization

For the proportion tests and the Montecarlo simulations that we are going to introduce, we can use parallelization using `BiocParallel`:

```{r}
# Set number of CPUs to use:
BiocParallel::register(BPPARAM =  BiocParallel::MulticoreParam(workers = 6))
```

### Differential proportion test - two conditions

The main feature of LotOfCells is the testing of differences in proportions, combined with a simulation of a random distribution to evaluate how extreme the observations might be. To compare the proportions of a specific class between two conditions, define the two classes and their order from the `main_variable` column. Optionally, the `sample_id` column (or another sub-class level) can be set to account for per-sample heterogeneity in the computational simulation.

***NOTE: for significance testing we recommend an $\alpha$ value of 0.001**

A plot of the differences in proportions is generated, with pink shades representing the standard deviation of the Monte Carlo simulations, and a dataframe containing the statistical results is returned.

```{r}
# # Test of 2 conditions using montecarlo and differences in percentage
labelOrder <- c("mut","wt")
results.2.conditions <- lotOfCells(scObject = meta.data,
                                      main_variable = "condition",
                                      subtype_variable = "cell_type",
                                      sample_id = "sample",
                                      permutations = 1000,
                                      labelOrder = labelOrder,
                                      parallel = TRUE)
print(results.2.conditions)
```

<figcaption><i> Test of differences in proportion. </i></figcaption>
</figure>

### Symmetric Divergence Score - global disregulation in class proportions

To determine if the majority of class proportions change significantly simultaneously between two conditions, we compute a divergence score based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. This score helps to understand the global dysregulation in class proportions. The process involves simulating a random distribution to assess how extreme the observed symmetric score is.

Higher divergence scores suggest more significant simultaneous changes in class proportions between the two conditions.

```{r}
# # Test of entropy for 2 conditions using montecarlo simulation
labelOrder <- c("mut","wt")
results.2.conditions.entropy <- entropyScore(scObject = meta.data,
          main_variable = "condition",
          subtype_variable = "cell_type",
          permutations = 10000,
          labelOrder = labelOrder,
          parallel = TRUE)
```

<figcaption><i> Test of symmetric entropy score in global proportions. </i></figcaption>
</figure>

### Differential proportion test - more than two conditions

The test of differences in proportions available in LotOfCells can be done with more than 2 conditions, by computing a Kendall rank correlation coefficient. To compare the proportions of a specific class between several conditions we will need to define the classes and the order in which they will be compared from the column specified in `main_variable`, the correlation (positive and negative) will be tested following the order defined. Optionally, like introduced above, we can set the sample_id column (or other sub-class level) to include the per-sample heterogeneity in the computational simulation.

```{r}
# # Test of correlation for SEVERAL conditions using Kendall rank correlation
labelOrder <- c("time 0h","time 2h","time 4h")
results.3.conditions <- lotOfCells(scObject = meta.data,
                                main_variable = "times",
                                subtype_variable = "cell_type",
                                sample_id = "sample",
                                permutations = 1000,
                                labelOrder = labelOrder,
                                parallel = TRUE)
head(results.3.conditions)
dynamics_chart(gammaResults = results.3.conditions)
```
